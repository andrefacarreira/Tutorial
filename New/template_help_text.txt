:: Intro
Thank you for downloading this free template release from www.clantemplates.com if you have any questions, 
these paragraphs should address them or direct you to where they can be addressed.

There are a few terms-of-use rules you need to follow if you want to use this or any ClanTemplates template 
but they are simple to follow. The first is that you must keep a link back to ClanTemplates either 
using a Lead Sponsor image or an affiliate link (dependent upon your template). This must be a hyperlink and 
must include the ClanTemplates 'C' logo. The second is that you must include any copyright footer that 
tells you who designed and coded the template. This image (and/or text) should also link to ClanTemplates and 
must not be edited.

All templates released at clantemplates are coded in html/xhtml &amp; css so that even the most inexperienced 
individual can understand and edit the template. If you have either Frontpage or Dreamweaver at your disposal 
these would be recommended for you to easily edit and manage the code of your new website template. Below are 
3 video tutorials that explain different aspects of how to use a template downloaded from Clantemplates.

:: Editing your Template

All templates released at Clantemplates should include blank banner images for you to add your own clans name 
to in order to personalize the template. Such images are generally included in the images folder which was in 
the zip file you downloaded and are normally denoted by the word 'blank' in the filename. Other blank images 
for various parts of a template, may be included in the folder, depending on the template you've downloaded.

:: Getting Help

Any questions that the video tutorials just didn't cover? Well the best place to get the kind of answers you 
need is to use that template you've downloaded is to submit your question for the Support Staff in the 
Clantemplates Help Booth (http://forums.clantemplates.com/forumdisplay.php?f=9). Make sure you

regarding a template they will be able to answer for you.
